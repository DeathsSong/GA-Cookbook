Questions:
-How do I query data within the ejs template? For instance, each recipe has the author id tied to it. How do I have it display the "name" of the id rather than the id#?  
--Or if one field has nothing, display "none" or omit altogether?

Login:
-Need view for login.
--After login or create user, change the header appropriately. Change the individual recipes pages to allow edit/delete only for author
-Need view for create user. Route POST with this one, then give a json web token as cookie.

ToDo:  
-Allow gte recipes by userID?
