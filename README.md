Questions:
-Logout not working - trying to pull objectId from getUserById for some reason?
-Also, seems like I'm always just logged in. After creating an account it works as intendend. But when checking my userId from let decodeCookie = jwt_decode(req.cookies.access_token), const userId = decodeCookie.userId, I get back an ID number that doesn't match any user. What is going on?
