ToDo by person:  
Cody:  
-OH Question - receiving error that route.get requires function but got object. The index one works fine, but in adding the ingredient list by id to test, this happened.  
-How do we add sub models list: in the same file: ie, we should only have recipe and user with ingredientlist somehow being typed into recipe?
